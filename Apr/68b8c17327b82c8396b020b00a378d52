Cape Town - She wooed the judges with her personality, presentation and eloquence and went on to be crowned Teen Miss Cape Rose 2021. Not only did Georgia Golliat step off the stage with the coveted title last weekend, but she also won best ramp, best dressed, best verbal skills and best personality in her category. Georgia was followed by Britney Kennedy and Nawaal Ishak. Georgia said the competition was fantastic. “I am grateful to be the winner of Teen Miss Cape Rose 2021. I was really nervous because it was my first competition on stage since lockdown. However, it was great to interact with models from different modelling schools and to be on stage again. “I am a proud South African young woman. With my knowledge, I believe that I have the power within me to inspire, uplift and show compassion to all those I interact with. “My message to younger girls is that if you enjoy what you're doing and put your mind and heart to something you can achieve anything,” she said. Britney said: “I was happy with my performance, I gave it my all and had loads of fun. It was great to see all my fellow models from the different modelling schools again as we were not able to compete for over a year. It was good to be back on stage.” Nawaal said: “I felt confident and empowered because I was not only representing myself but my community. I have a huge support system from my family, to friends and peers at the youth group. They are always in my corner and push me to do better.” Contestants modelled in smart casual attire and gave a 30-second on stage introduction about themselves. All the money raised will be used to buy Dignity Dream pads for girls in need. Weekend Argus

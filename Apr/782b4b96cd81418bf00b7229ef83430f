Cape Town - School children were among the supporters who gathered outside the Western Cape Education Department (WCED) offices on Wednesday  to support Heathfield High School principal Wesley Neumann. At the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, Neumann refused to re-open the school and the WCED instituted disciplinary proceedings against him. Neumann’ s disciplinary hearing officially started in September. He faces six charges relating to his refusal to re-open Heathfield High School. The governing body of the school has previously shown it’s support for Neumann and his leadership of the teaching staff and pupils. On Wednesday pupils from southern suburb schools joined Heathfield with placards at the WCED offices where Neumann’s disciplinary hearing continues. In February, activists who supported the principal called for charges against him to be dropped and failing which for his hearing to be opened to the public.

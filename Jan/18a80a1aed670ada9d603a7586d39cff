TWO of South Africa’s premiere DJs are off the air after being accused of rape. DJ Fresh and Euphonik will no longer occupy their regular slots on 947, and Fresh’s slot on Kfm, after allegations of sexual assault were levelled against them on social media. The announcement came on Saturday morning from Primedia Broadcasting’s acting chief executive Geraint Crwys-Williams. Primedia owns both music radio stations. “947 and Primedia Broadcasting have engaged with DJ Fresh (Thato Sikwane) and Euphonik (Themba Nkosi) regarding the alleged sexual assault charges levelled against them,” Crwys-Williams said. “We take these matters extremely seriously and apply a rigorous, systematic internal process to assess them. Primedia Broadcasting, DJ Fresh and Euphonik have reached a mutual decision for both DJs to come off air in order to focus on addressing this matter.” Around the same time, both men took to social media and issued a joint statement. “In light of the serious allegations levelled against us we’ve decided to step away from all public work engagements until such time that this matter has been resolved and the law has taken its course,” they said. On Friday, Gauteng police confirmed a case of rape had been opened against the two men at Sunnyside police station.

ED WESTWICK is the talk of the town as he enjoys a holiday in the Mother City. The former Gossip Girl  actor has been spotted throughout Cape Town, taking in the sights and sounds with his partner, Italian-South African model Tamara Francesconi. Westwick was reportedly meeting Francesconiâ€™s family while staying in the country, a few months after the couple had celebrated their one-year anniversary in October. Westwick was first spotted at the Four Seasons Hotel in Joburg last week, before making his way to the Lion Sands private reserve in the Kruger National Park. The actor arrived in Cape Town on Friday and by the shots on his social media, was enjoying the views of the Silo Hotel at the V&A Waterfront. From there, he moved on to the La Residence hotel in Franschhoek, but not before encountering fans in Sea Point who uploaded photographs with him to TikTok. Westwick and Francesconi got to know each other in 2019 while Francesconi was staying in London, kicked off by a first date at a butterfly sanctuary in Mayfair and happening just over a year after Westwick seperated from American actress, Jessica Serfaty. Francesconi has said the couple had grown more dependent on each other over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic. Westwick is best known for his Gossip Girl role as rich kid Chuck Bass. The series ran from 2007 to 2012. His most recent appearances include the BBC series White Gold, and the 2020 film Enemy Lines.

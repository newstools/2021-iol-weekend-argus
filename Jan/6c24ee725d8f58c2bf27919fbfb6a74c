THE search for the 2-year-old girl missing at sea in Herold’s Bay has been scaled down. The child has been missing since January 21 when her mother drove the car they were in off a cliff along Voëlklip Road and into the sea. The 34-year-old woman’s body was recovered and her 8-year-old son, who was also in the car, survived the incident. Police divers have been scouring the ocean every day since the incident and yesterday confirmed that they would be scaling down the search. Southern Cape police spokesperson Captain Malcolm Poje said: “We are scaling down the search significantly but will resume on Monday.” On Tuesday, a body believed to be that of the missing girl was spotted in the ocean – but divers were unable to reach there in time. The search continued in earnest, but after 10 days it will now be scaled down. Chairperson of the Herold’s Bay Ratepayers Association Ken Field said the search has not been easy. “It’s very difficult for divers to get in and get near to the place because it’s right against the rocks ... the sea has been rough for the last couple of days,” said Field. Meanwhile, discussions are under way between George and Herold’s Bay authorities about the future of that stretch of road. In 2019, there were two incidents of women who’s cars left the Voëlklip Road and plunged into the ocean and last year, a man died when he reportedly crashed his car and it skidded over the cliff edge. Field said: “A task team has been formed and in the future, there will be traffic calming measures in place, but there are a minority of people who want the road closed.”

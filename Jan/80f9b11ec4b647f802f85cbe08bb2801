Johannesburg - High-profile author, journalist and talk show host Redi Thlabi has voiced her support for a woman who has accused two radio DJs of rape on social media. Radio 947’s Thato Sikwane, popularly known as DJ Fresh and host of the #FreshSundayz show on KFM, and Themba “Euphonik” Nkosi have been accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a party back in 2011. On Saturday, the duo and the radio station said they had reached a mutal agreement and the two would come off air. Gauteng police authorities on Friday confirmed a case against the two men had been opened on January 13 at Sunnyside police station. The allegations were posted on Twitter this week. Thlabi responded to the case, voicing support for the woman. “I believe her. Even when the accused is a respected peer, I believe her. The allegations are too serious to ignore,” she wrote. Thlabi continued: “I have a warm relationship of mutual respect with one of the accused. I say this deliberately because often we don’t believe victims precisely because we falsely assume men we know are not capable of certain actions. This contributes to doubt and victimisation of the victim. It’s wrong.” Actress and poet Lebogang Mashile also commended the woman for her bravery, writing “I believe you Sisi. These two have been named in far too many stories of abuse. It’s consistent ...” Both men issued a joint statement on social media: “In light of the serious allegations levelled against us, we’ve decided to step away from all public work engagements until ... this matter has been resolved and the law has taken its course.” Weekend Argus

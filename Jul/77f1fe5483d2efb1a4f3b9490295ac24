Cape Town - While Cape residents have managed to enjoy some respite from the rain and enjoy the sunshine over the last couple of days, another cold front will arrive on Thursday morning. The City of Cape Town’s Disaster Risk Management Centre (DRMC) said that all City services and external partners are on standby for the latest cold front expected. The South African Weather Service (SAWS) alerted the City’s DRMC of the following warnings for Thursday, July 8: “While the front is forecast to be considerably shorter in duration than the multiple days of inclement weather experienced last week – heavy rainfall, over short periods, could result in localised flooding,” DRMC spokesperson Charlotte Powell said. In the event that there are any threats to life or property as a result of the weather, residents are advised to call the City’s Public Emergency Communication Centre by dialling 021 480 7700 from a cellphone or 107 from a landline. Following heavy rainfall that initially made landfall last week, the City and other affected municipalities continued with assessments and mopping-up operations this week. The storm last week affected large parts of the province. Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning MEC Anton Bredell said there have been no reports of casualties, missing or injured persons. Cape Argus

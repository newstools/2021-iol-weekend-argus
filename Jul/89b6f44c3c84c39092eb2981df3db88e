The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has given accreditation for FAR UVC light technology which has been proven to kill airborne bacteria and viruses. The technology is being used around the world as well as in South Africa. The managing director of manufacturer FAR UVC Africa Conrad Kullmann said: “Our technology offers a one-of-a-kind real-time air and surface sanitation solution. No other product is able to effectively kill SARS-Cov-2  and all other pathogens and bacteria, in the air and on surfaces of occupied spaces with the speed and effectiveness of Far- UVC.” He added: “Far-UVC light, unlike UV-C light, does not penetrate the skin or eyes making it 100% safe for humans and animals alike.” The products are designed and assembled in SA and uses an imported built-in technology that has been used by the healthcare industry to destroy superbugs in hospitals. This technology can be used in  homes, public spaces such as restaurants and supermarkets and other enclosed areas. Kullman said: “By using far-UVC light sanitising technology, it’s possible to disinfect the whole body within eight seconds. while providing everyone with the peace of mind, of knowing that they are safe and protected.” FAR UVC Africa is based in Joburg and has 15 products available for purchase that uses this UVC technology. UV sterilisation is not a new technology or concept, but its application and use is being adapted around the world during the Covid-19 pandemic. Weekend Argus

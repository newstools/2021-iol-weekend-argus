THE fate of Mossel Bay’s municipal manager will be decided on Friday when council rules on whether or not to suspend him pending disciplinary actions on allegations of sexual harassment. Thys Giliomee has until Thursday to furnish the council with reasons as to why he should not be placed on suspicion. Back in April Giliomee was placed on special leave pending an investigation into allegations of misconduct. However, during a council meeting on June 3, a decision was taken to give Giliomee a week to write to council motivating why he shouldn’t be suspended. “The council resolved that in terms of the investigation report, a prima facie case of serious misconduct in the form of sexual harassment has been established,” said the municipality in a statement. “It was resolved to institute disciplinary proceedings against the municipal manager due to the alleged misconduct being deemed to be of a serious nature.” The municipality’s manager for community safety, Colin Puren was appointed the acting municipal manager until the outcome of the disciplinary matter. Spokesperson for the municipality Nickey Le Roux said the next council meeting is scheduled to sit on June 11, where council will come to a decision on the matter based on the responses provided by Giliomee. The 58-year-old was appointed to the position back in December, 2016 to replace Dr Michele Gratz who had resigned.

Cape Town - While preparing for the inevitable third wave of Covid-19 infections, the Western Cape Health Department said they were aware and prepared for the H10N3 strain of bird flu. On Tuesday, Chinese health authorities confirmed that they were treating a 41-year-old man who had contracted this strain of bird flu. The man had reportedly developed a fever, coupled with other flu-like symptoms when the diagnosis was made. The H10N3 is believed to be a much less severe strain of the virus in poultry and the risk of it spreading on a large scale at this stage is believed to be very low. Head of Western Cape Health Dr Keith Cloete said even before Covid-19, they were prepared for these kinds of health emergencies. “Part of the reason why in this province we were in a sense geared towards Covid, is that over the years we have done extensive preparation for outbreaks of any nature.... especially for a virus that has its origin in animals,” said Cloete. He added: “We have a proud track in this province of dealing with H1N1... (and) when Ebola was a threat. In fact in 2006 and 2007 there was an extensive avian flu preparedness panic plan that I personally worked on.” Cloete said between the provincial Departments of Health and Agriculture they would be able to cope with any type of outbreaks. “There has been quite a lot of endemic avian flu cases among ostriches in the Garden Route and we worked very closely with our colleagues over the years.” He said: “We’re very well aware of avian flu and our systems can deal with outbreaks of any nature of that kind.” Cloete did not confirm what the testing or monitoring plans were in place for this latest avian flu strain.

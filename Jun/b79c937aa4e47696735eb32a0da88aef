CAPE TOWN - SA is technically in a third wave, says National institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) Executive Director, Prof. Adrian Puren. On Wednesday, the country recorded the highest number of new coronavirus infections in more than four months indicating that the country was officially entering the third wave. Speaking on SABC’s Morning Live, Puren said technically the situation in the country could be described as a third wave as the whole country had reached the threshold. “The overall positivity is at 12.7% nationally, but if you could allocate it by province the positive rate could be higher. In Gauteng it’s about 17 %, Free State is about 15%, Northern Cape 23%, North West 18%. So that really means we should really enhance our testing and identity cases in order to get a better sense of the current outbreak in South Africa,” he said. The country recorded an increase of 5 782 new cases and 110 Covid-19 related deaths yesterday, taking the total number of cases to date to 1 675 013. The new infections came from 45 484 tests. #COVID19 UPDATE: A total of 45 484 tests were conducted in the last 24 hrs, with 5 782 new cases, which represents a 12.7% positivity rate.

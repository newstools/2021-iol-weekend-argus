He was wearing black and white Nike track pants, black body warmer, red Nike slippers and pink socks. He can also be identified by his tattoos, one his right arm that reads “Waylon” and another on his left arm which reads “undefeated”. Tyrese has short brown hair and is about 1.4m tall. His weight is about 45kg. Police spokesperson warrant officer Joseph Swartbooi confirmed that a missing person enquiry was registered at Delft police station and that the investigation is still ongoing. His mother Sabrina Armoed said that since her son’s disappearance there had been rumours of people laying in the bushes but every time the family went to check, there was nothing. “He was always so cheerful, making things fun with jokes. He has a little brother and we are all looking for him. He had a very good relationship with his brother who is 8. He would listen and do as he was told in the house, he is a very good son,” she said. Western Cape Missing Persons founder Candice Van Der Rheede urges the public to be on the lookout for Tyrese. “Wearing of masks makes it very difficult for tracing but please do try and see if you do recognise the missing person and please contact the numbers on the flyers” said Van Der Rheede.

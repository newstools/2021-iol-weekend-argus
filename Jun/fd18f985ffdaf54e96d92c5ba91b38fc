DISGRUNTLED ANC staff members in the Western Cape are also planning to join the national picket against salary disputes with the ruling party. On June 9, the party’s national spokesperson Pule Mabe confirmed the party had been given a notice of a planned industrial action for June 15. The picketing is said to take place at Luthuli House and at provincial and regional ANC offices across the country. “Although staff were informed that officials are attending to the ANC cash flow challenges, the feeling of grievance around their conditions of employment has reached critical point,” read the statement. In the Western Cape workers say they will also take part in the demonstration to highlight challenges that affect workers. “It’s mainly about salaries, that there were no increases, the late payments of salaries and that there are arrears to the provident fund,” said one of the employees Mvusi Mdala. “Workers will mainly congregate at Constitution House in Cape Town and we expect workers from other regions to join us here in solidarity but adhering to social distancing regulations.” Last month deputy secretary-general, Jessie Duarte conceded that the party was having financial difficulties. This followed reports of numerous complaints from workers who were receiving their salaries in batches and later than the agreed upon date of the 25 of each month. The party’s provincial interim leader, Lerumo Kalako, said ANC leaders will be on hand on the day to receive the memorandum from workers.

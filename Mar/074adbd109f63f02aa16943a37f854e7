 Human Rights Day is a chance to reflect on how far we have come and what more still needs to be done to create a more equal and just society. This is what artist, scholar and entrepreneur Adebola Ola will discuss in his Facebook Live session on the Weekend Argus Facebook page on Sunday at 2pm. Ola will be looking at institutional racism and how it is distinguished from the explicit attitudes or racial bias of individuals by the existence of systematic policies or laws and practices that provide differential access to goods, services and opportunities of society by race. He said: “There are numerous ways to talk about institutionalised racism and while preparing I went on the internet, not that I haven’t experienced it myself, and I decided to take a different approach to the topic.” Ola said although his approach has been a bit different, it was enlightening for him and hopefully will be for the audience as well. He will discuss material from one of his favourite books, The Palm-wine Drinkard by Amos Tutuola, and also weave his narrative about his own experiences as both an academic and scholar. Ola said: “To sum it up, I argue and present that human nature in itself is incomplete and that we become complete by borrowing from other people. “I give examples of my own experience, but my conclusion is that there is no such thing as a race that can be complete on its own.” He said: “The belief that other people have not contributed enough or at all so they do not deserve to be appropriately included in the dividend of society is a reality out there.” This Human Rights Day, join Ola on the Weekend Argus Facebook page at 2pm as he unpacks this topic.

SPECIAL tributes were made and many people took a walk down memory lane as they recalled the life and work of Struggle activist Cecyl Esau. The Struggle stalwart’s memorial service was held in the Worcester Town Hall on Saturday. Speakers who paid tribute to the 66-year-old who died on March 17 included Dr Allan Boesak, Major-General Jeremy Vearey and Judge Siraj Desai. The ANC’s Lerumo Kalako also paid his respects and hailed Esau as a natural leader. He said: “Positions and possessions were not what you were after, you would never demand reward.” Kalako added: “(Esau) rejected a style of leadership that intimidates and abuses power, you valued people, you valued comradeship ... you were a natural leader, Comrade Cecyl.” The memorial service of Cecyl Esau is underway in Worcester.

With his smile, his everlasting smile, he left home and he went into the world armed with the principles that he was taught at home,” said June. She added: “Our parents told us one of the values was, never allow anybody to make you a nobody.” Esau is survived by five children, his sister June and two brothers, Alexander and Jacob.

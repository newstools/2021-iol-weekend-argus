 Locally made spirits and, particularly gins,  are popular at Cape Town bars and restaurants. The team at Deep South Distillery are on top of the latest trends when it comes to gin and spirits. A visit to the distillery near Kommetjie is a worthwhile experience. Visitors can discover what authentic small-batch distilling is all about and try their grapefruit schnapps, rums and brand new premium vodka. “Our delicious gins have won several medals, and we are busy developing some amazing rum and vodka recipes, but in fact, we are always experimenting with flavours and aromas, so invariably, there is the odd schnapps or liqueur to be found in the distillery.  We also do contract distillation for a few select clients,” reads their website. The distillery is known for its innovative and distinctive spirits. Its classic Cape Dry Gin has won medals, locally and abroad. The latest addition is the Spice Island Gin, a tribute to the Spice Islands of the Indian Ocean, and in the same vein, the distillery now has a chilli vodka, designed specifically for the Bloody Mary cocktail.

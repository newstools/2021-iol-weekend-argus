On Saturday, Dixon Mohamed will take us inside her kitchen, sharing her Ramadaan cooking secrets and the significance of the holy month and celebration. Her ideas are literally what tickles the palate and she first introduces her creations to her family first to get an approval. Viewers will be learning about a nifty and creative way to make the traditional trifle with a twist using basic ingredients like cream and yoghurt. Dixon Mohammed will be creating single serving portions of trifle for that special Ramadaan dessert. “It will be trifle with a twist,” she said. “Instead of sponge cake, I will be using a butter biscuit instead and caramel yoghurt, for example. “The custard is very important and it will be topped with cream and a syrup like rose flavoured. “The trifle will be smaller than the traditional size in a large bowl but in a glass cup to make a single serving.” She said she will be sharing her Ramadaan dessert tips which have become a part of tradition in Cape Town homes.

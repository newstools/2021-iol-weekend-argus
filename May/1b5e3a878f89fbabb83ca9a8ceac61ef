STAFF REPORTER CAPE TOWN: Three suspects will appear in court tomorrow, for alleged trafficking charges. Hawks spokesperson Captain Yolisa Mgolodela said two males and a female are expected to appear in the Keiskammahoek Magistrate’s Court tomorrow. She said the trio, aged 32, 36 and 42, were arrested by the East London-based Hawks serious organised crime investigation team, and King William’s Town K9 unit, on Wednesday. “It is alleged that, during the period between February 2019 to March 2021, the arrested female – who is a mother to a 13-year-old who suffers from down syndrome – sold her and a 15-year-old to the male suspects, who are shop owners in Keiskammahoek, for sexual exploitation,” said Mgolodela. She added that the matter was reported to the East London serious organised crime investigation team for probing, which led to the arrest of the trio. National Human Trafficking Hotline (NHTH) said, in relation to human trafficking, there are various different types of exploitation, but the more common ones in South Africa is trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation, forced labour, forced marriage, or trafficking for organs/ body parts to be used in traditional medicines or rituals. NHTH said any person could commit this crime – it can be a family member, a trusted friend or a community member. NHTH added that anyone who knowingly contributes to the trafficking of people, with the intent of exploiting a victim, is considered a human trafficker – this includes recruiters, intermediaries, transporters, document providers, corrupt officials and employers.

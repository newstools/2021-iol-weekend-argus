THE Western Cape will host four by-elections that would be the last round before the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) holds municipal elections in October. The by-elections are scheduled to take place on June 30, with two in the City of Cape Town Metro, one in the Cederberg Municipality and the other in Swartland. This is what the newly-appointed head of the IEC in the Western Cape, Michael Hendrikse, said while was briefing the standing committee on local government in the legislature on the commission’s readiness to hold elections in five months’ time. Ward 51 in Langa became vacant after ANC councillor Zingisile Nkangana died having served for just three months after winning the by-election last November to replace a councillor who had died from Covid-19 complications. Ward 63 and ward one in Cederberg also became vacant as a result of the deaths of councillors, while ward two in Moorreesburg in Swartland became vacant after Clive Papers resigned from the DA to join the Good Party. “We will be opening voting stations on Saturday (yesterday) and Sunday (today) for registration weekend for these by-elections and I want to stress this is only registration for those by-elections,” said Hendrikse. He said work was under way to boost the number of registered voters in the Western Cape for the 2021 local government elections. He said by May 4, around 3 million people in the Western Cape were registered to vote with 1.6 million voters being female and 1.3 million male. Of the 3 million, only 3 490 of them are aged 18-19 while those aged  30-39 and 40-49 had the highest numbers at 717 049 and 709 164 respectively. Voter registration is expected to take place on July 17 and 18.

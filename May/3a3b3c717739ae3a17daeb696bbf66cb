CAPE TOWN - A 33-year-old man appeared in court this morning  after he was nabbed with 23 pieces of gold worth R11 million at the OR Tambo Airport. Authorities arrested him the week after he failed to declare that he had 23 pieces of gold inside his luggage. The arrest was made by the Hawks Serious and Violent Crime Investigation team on Saturday.

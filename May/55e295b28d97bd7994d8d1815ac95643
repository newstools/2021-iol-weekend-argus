The following morning, while conducting foot patrols, the team found 11 net bags containing 500 abalone. On 13 May 2021, one suspected poacher was arrested at Miller’s Point for possession of 20 shucked and four whole state abalone.     TMNP Park Manager, Frans van Rooyen said: “All confiscated items were booked with the South African Police Services. A case of poaching has been opened with the SAPS in Simons Town”. He added that TMNP together with its law enforcement partners in the SAPS, City of Cape Town and other agencies are working together to fight the scourge of abalone poaching. “The teams have been conducting daily sea patrols in the Marine Protected Areas of TMNP to fight against poaching that threatens the Marine Resources.” “We really appreciate the assistance and support we are getting from the City of Cape Town Marine Law Enforcement Unit and SAPS. I'd also like to thank the TMNP rangers for a spectacular job well done,” concluded van Rooyen.

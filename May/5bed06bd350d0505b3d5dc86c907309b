At the Reaching for Young Stars launch workshop, a few key cooking tips were highlighted for the budding young chefs. The speakers who eagerly shared their advice were Brenda Wilkinson, Gidi Caetano, Guy Webber and Annette Kesler. Herbs Do not be afraid to start a herb garden and to explore cooking with them. Herbs are useful for their medicinal value and are a cheap alternative to adding flavour to your dishes in a healthy way. Truffles Truffles offer a distinct aroma at the proper ripeness and have a distinct taste, too. To add a little something extra to your cooking, use truffles as a base for your dishes. This ingredient is mainly used in sauces, butter or ice cream. Mushrooms Mushrooms are nutritious and typically considered to aid various health ailments, while boosting your immune system. They pair well with casseroles, salads and especially egg dishes. Olive Oil It pays to have a good quality olive oil in your kitchen, even if it comes at a higher price. For a longer shelf-life, purchase olive oil in a glass bottle. Although these might come in smaller bottles at times, you do not want to forego quality for volume. Check the ingredients, check the labels. Wine When choosing which wine to pair with your meal, remember that the wine is there first. It is now your job to tweak the food to the wine. Take some time to have a sip and study the flavour profile of the wine you'd like to use.

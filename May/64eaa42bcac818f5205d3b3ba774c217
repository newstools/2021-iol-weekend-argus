Bonginkosi Madikizela has also resigned as a member of the Western Cape Legislature. Speaker of the Provincial Legislature  Masizole Mnqasela made the announcement on Wednesday stating that the resignation was in effect from April 28. This was the same day Madikizela announced his resignation as both the DA’s provincial leader as well as MEC for Transport and Public Works. His resignations come after news broke that he did not possess a BComm Degree in Human Resource Management as was previously stated in his CV. Premier Alan Winde is yet to announce who will replace Madikizela in his provincial cabinet and now a replacement will also be needed to occupy the DA’s seat in the Legislature. “Once a vacancy has been declared the relevant party will send a name and that person will be sworn in,” explains Mnqasela. “At this stage no name has been provided as yet.” Provincial chairperson Jaco Londt said the party’s provincial executive committee would make a decision on this matter soon. The DA is also set to elect an interim provincial leader at a council meeting on May  29, until the party can hold a provincial conference. It remains unclear when this will take place given how the last conference was only six months ago.

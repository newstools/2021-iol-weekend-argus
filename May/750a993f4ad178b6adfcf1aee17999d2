 The world is changing at a rapid pace and with all the trauma that was experienced during the Covid-19 pandemic, depression, anxiety and stress are more prevalent. On Friday, counselling psychologist Dr Nkateko Ndala Magoro will present a Facebook Live on workplace mental health. People will have an opportunity to engage in a question-and-answer session with with Magoro. She has 10 years of experience in psychology and has worked in various organisations, student environments and cultures. The experience she gained in doing so has helped her gain immeasurable insight into the dynamics of human behaviour. The spectrum of her expertise includes relationships and family issues, psychometric assessments, psychotherapy and leadership development. “Psychology is a space where people work with mental health. However, I view mental health from a holistic aspect. To look at the mental health of a person, we also have to look at their spiritual and physical well-being,” Magoro said. Magoro believes that dialogue regarding mental illness should not only occur when someone is severely mentally ill but as a part of our daily lives. Magoro said: “Without mental health, we cannot be present. If someone is not doing well emotionally, they cannot be productive.” In a corporation, many employees often push themselves to get work done even when they are not doing well mentally. “Pausing and taking time out might be seen as a loss in the workspace but taking care of yourself will make you productive,” she added. Those who tune in to the Facebook live can expect tips on how to cope with stress and depression and how to communicate this to your superiors at work. If you are looking for help and support on how to navigate your job and mental illness, Magoro has advice for you. Join our Facebook Live on Friday, May 21, at 1pm on the Weekend Argus Facebook page.

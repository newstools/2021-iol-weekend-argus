A 9-year-old boy was shot and killed after a policeman allegedly left a firearm unattended in his house in Mbekweni, near Paarl. Reports have alleged that the boy was with his friend in the house on Friday when the incident happened. Police confirmed the incident and said a murder case had been opened and the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) had launched an investigation. According to the FireArms Control Act, firearms should be kept in a lock-away safe or vault for safe keeping when not in use. IPID Spokesperson Ndileka Cola said they were investigating "death as a result of police action". The incident comes as the crime figures released by Police Minister  Bheki Cele on Friday showed an increase in murder and attempted murder rates across the country in January to March compared to the same period last years. Cele noted that 4 976 people were killed in the first three months of 2021, 387 more compared to the same period in 2020. Residents who spoke on condition of anonymity voiced concerns over the surge in crime in the township. They spoke of shootings "now becoming common"  and "kangaroo courts" where people were killed. "In February 2020, we called a crime imbizo to discuss ways of stemming the rising criminality and violence. We saw a slight change during COVID-19 but it appears that it has gone up again," said one. He added that the township had also seen an increase in taxi-related shootings.

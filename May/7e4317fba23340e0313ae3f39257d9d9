 JUST three months after the DA’s Derick Welgemoed was elected as speaker in the ANC controlled Beaufort West municipality - he has been removed. And the DA in the region  cried foul after Wednesday’s council meeting saw Welgemoed removed through a motion of no confidence vote. Welgemoed was voted in to the position in February after the ANC’s speaker was expelled from his party following allegations he was working with the opposition in council - paving the way for a council with leadership from three different political parties. “The DA’s short occupation of the Speaker position in Beaufort West is over. The ANC and its coalition partner, raised and passed a motion of no confidence in the DA Speaker and elected Letticia Davids and reclaimed this position,” said the party’s Central Karoo regional secretary, Winde Plaatjie. However, the DA claimed the notice for the council meeting seeking to remove the Speaker did not comply with requirements and therefore any decisions taken at the meeting were illegal. “The speaker informed the relevant coalition parties that their notice did not comply with the requirements to convene a council and that all decisions made at the meeting will not be legal,” said the party’s east region chairperson, Tertuis Simmers. “The conduct of the ANC/KDF-coalition is a clear display of their contempt of the council’s rules of conduct. We call on (MEC) for Local Government , Anton Bredell to address the matter immediately.”

THE DA’s Albert Fritz has been elected the interim leader in the Western Cape. Fritz assumed the position on Friday  after the only other contender for the position, fellow Western Cape MPL Wendy Philander, pulled out of the race. Fritz, who is the deputy leader, has been acting provincial leader after Bonginkosi Madikizela vacated the position when it came to light that he had lied in his CV about having a BCom Degree in Human Resources Management. The party’s provincial chairperson Jaco Londt says Fritz was elected unopposed after Philander withdrew from the race cancelling the need for a full-on vote at a council meeting scheduled for May  29. He said the position of deputy leader would be filled at the party’s next provincial council meeting scheduled for August or September. In a video statement to thank his supporters, Fritz also called on party members to unite in order to strengthen the DA. “I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to each and every one of you for the message of support and the confidence all of you showed in me is humbling and I sincerely hope I can live up to expectations,” he said. “I want to appeal to each and every democrat to unite within our structures. Let’s get behind our party leadership and work towards building this party. We all know South Africa needs a strong united DA. The time has come for us to put our differences to one side and focus on the task at hand.”

THREE municipalities in the Western Cape account for nearly 90% of the R113.3million in debt, older than 30 days, owed to service providers. According to the latest consolidated financial statement for the third quarter that ended on March 31, published by MEC for Economic Development David Maynier in the provincial gazette, municipalities in the province reported that creditors were owed R434 million of which R113.3 million is more than 30 days overdue. And according to legislation all valid invoices must be paid within 30 days as a means to limit  the impact of late or non-payment of invoices, particularly to small businesses. Kannaland, Cederberg and Beaufort West Municipalities owed a combined R94.6 million, largely, to Eskom, the Auditor General and other creditors. Kannaland has been under administration since 2018 and is being assisted with a financial recovery plan. Meanwhile municipalities in the province are owed R13.3 billion in consumer debt for the third quarter of the 2020/2021 financial year, a slight decrease when compared to the second quarter which stood at R13.4 billion. “The largest share is owed by households, which account for R9.7 billion or 73% of the total, noting a slight decline of 1.1% from the R9.89 billion reported in the previous quarter,” read the document. “Organs of state account for R258.91 million or 2% of the total debt. Debtors older than 90 days amount to R9.4billion or 70% of the total outstanding debtors of R13.3billion. “This amount represents a decrease of 0.4% from the R9.39 billion reported in quarter two of 2020/21. These amounts include historic debt that has accumulated over an extended period, interest on arrears and other recoveries.” Weekend Argus

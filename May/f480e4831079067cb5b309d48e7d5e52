A CAPE Town man, 66, drowned after being swept away by currents at Grotto Beach in Hermanus on Friday. The man, his daughter and grandson were walking along the lagoon shore when he and his grandson waded into the shallow waters. The elderly man soon got caught up in the current. The banks at the lagoon had broken last week due to heavy rainfall. The man was assisted to shore by his daughter and bystander while the child managed to get to shore safely,  the NSRI said. An NSRI paramedic declared the man dead on the scene.
